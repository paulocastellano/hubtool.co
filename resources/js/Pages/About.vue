            About HubTool.co is a personal endeavor, just like Logsnag, managed
            with a human touch. Hello there! I'm Paulo Castellano, the sole
            creator of HubTool.co, born from my own efforts, without reliance on
            external funding or advertising. What began as a modest side project
            has evolved into something much more significant for me. Since 2019,
            I've been dedicatedly adding a new tool daily, chosen from the
            multitude of suggestions I receive monthly. I meticulously examine
            your landing pages, delve into your creative ideas, and handpick
            only the best to feature for our community. Running HubTool.co
            single-handedly demands considerable time, but it also empowers me
            with the flexibility to swiftly adapt and enhance the website. Your
            input is invaluable, and I actively use it to make continuous
            improvements. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the millions who have
            visited HubTool.co over the years. Your support has enabled me to
            realize my ultimate dream: achieving independence. Paulo Castellano
